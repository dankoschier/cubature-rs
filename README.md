# cubature-rs

This rust crate is a safe wrapper around the [cubature-sys](https://github.com/dankoschier/cubature-sys) crate which, in turn, provides rust-bindings to the [cubature](https://github.com/stevengj/cubature) package written by [Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj).
The software can be used for the **adaptive multidimensional integration** (*cubature*) of **vector-valued integrands** over **hypercubes**.
